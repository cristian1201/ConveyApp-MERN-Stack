# Convey Engineering Take-Home Exercise - MERN Stack

***(2020.11.10 writen by Cristian P.)***

## Requirement

Hi! We’re excited you’re interested in coming to work with us. Below is an exercise that will help us get know your skills and strengths. Please do not spend more than four hours on the exercise even if unfinished. If you find yourself going past that please reach out to discuss.

You may use any library or system you like, but we recommend our [boilerplate app](https://github.com/getconvey/interview-boilerplates/tree/master/node-react) to save you time.

We will evaluate your program for correctness. We will also consider its design, efficiency, and readability. You should test the code enough to know it’s correct and are encouraged to include tests in your submission. Additionally please include a summary of how your code works, how to run it, and list any trade-offs or assumptions.

Please submit your source files in a regular zip or tar.gz file to us at chad@getconvey.com. You may also send any clarification or process questions to us at this address. Please also let us know how much time you spent and any other feedback.

Feel free to use standard libraries and internet references, however all work must be your own.

Thanks and good luck!
